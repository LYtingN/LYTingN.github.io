#### RL quadruped load adaptation, Haining, China

Oct. 2024--Today

Advisor: Prof. Naira Hovakimyan (UIUC), Dr. Sheng, Chen

- Quadrotor helilogging control

- Smoothly landing in the end

- Use ROS as platform

#### RL quadruped load adaptation, Haining, China

May. 2024--Sep. 2024

Advisor: Prof. Liangjing, Yang (iZJU), Prof. Hua, Chen (iZJU)

- Quadruped Robotics Go2 can walk only on the joint information of itself (use teacher-student model)

- Go2 can balance loads on its base well

- Use issac_gym and legged_gym as basic platforms to train Go2 in the simulation

- Self-adaptation without knowing the information of loadings

- Propose to ICRA(not received yet)
