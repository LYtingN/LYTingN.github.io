#### RL quadruped load adaptation, Haining, China

May. 2024--Today

Advisor: Prof. Liangjing, Yang (iZJU)

- Quadruped Robotics Go2 can walk only on the joint information of itself (use teacher-student model)

- Use issac_gym and legged_gym as basic platforms to train Go2 in the simulation

- Self-adaptation without knowing the information of loadings

- Still under constructing ...
